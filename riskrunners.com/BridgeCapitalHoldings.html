The system of subsidiary alliances was pioneered by the French East India Company governor Joseph François Dupleix, who in the late 1740s established treaties with the Nizam of Hyderabad, India, and other Indian princes in the Carnatic.It stated that the Indian rulers who formed a treaty with the British would be provided with protection against any external attacks in place that the rulers were (a) required to keep the British army at the capitals of their states (b)they were either to give either money or some territory to the company for the maintenance of the British troops (c) they were to turn out from their states all non-english europeans whether they were employed in the army or in the civil service and (d)they had to keep a British official called 'resident' at the capital of their respective states who would oversee all the negotiations and talks with the other states which meant that the rulers were to have no direct correspondence or relations with the other states .</td>
