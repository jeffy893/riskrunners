It is made up of the following four drugs:\n\nFOL – folinic acid (leucovorin), a vitamin B derivative that enhances the effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU);\nF –   fluorouracil (5-FU), a pyrimidine analog and antimetabolite which incorporates into the DNA molecule and stops DNA synthesis;\nIRIN – irinotecan (Camptosar), a topoisomerase inhibitor, which prevents DNA from uncoiling and duplicating; and\nOX – oxaliplatin (Eloxatin), a platinum-based antineoplastic agent, which inhibits DNA repair and/or DNA synthesis.The regimen emerged in 2010 as a new treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</td>
