The federal government was unable to meet this goal in 8 years until FY2013 when it subcontracted over $83 billion from small businesses.Fiscal year 2015 marked several historic achievements; the federal government exceeded their overall goal of 23% by 2.75% resulting in $90.7 billion dollars awarded to small businesses, 5.05% ($17.8 billion) of which went to women-owned small business (WOSB), meeting the goal for the first time since it was implemented in 1996.The top five departments by dollars obligated in 2015 were the Department of Defense ($212.5 billion), Department of Energy ($23 billion), Health and Human Services ($21 billion), Department of Veteran Affairs ($20 billion), and NASA ($13 billion).</td>
