The ISO 15510 standard lists the chemical compositions of stainless steels of the specifications in existing ISO, ASTM, EN, JIS, and GB standards in a useful interchange table.Stainless steel's resistance to rusting results from the presence of chromium in the alloy, which forms a passive film that protects the underlying material from corrosion attack, and can self-heal in the presence of oxygen.: 3  Corrosion resistance can be increased further by the following means:\n\nincrease chromium content to more than 11%\nadd nickel to at least 8%\nadd molybdenum (which also improves resistance to pitting corrosion)The addition of nitrogen also improves resistance to pitting corrosion and increases mechanical strength.</td>
