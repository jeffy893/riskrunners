      <td>Public interest law refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor, marginalized, or under-represented people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms (pro bono publico), often in the fields of civil rights, civil liberties, religious liberty, human rights, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.In a celebrated 1905 speech, Louis Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that "able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people."In the tradition thus exemplified, a common ethic for public-interest lawyers in a growing number of countries remains "fighting for the little guy".\n\n\n== By jurisdiction ==\n\n\n=== Central and Eastern Europe ===\nAt the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage.</td>

The journal publishes articles on "topics related to procedure, evidence, trial and appellate advocacy, alternative dispute resolution, and often-litigated substantive law."The journal publishes four issues annually, one of which is a symposium issue published in collaboration with the litigation section of American Association of Law Schools. Past topics have included mass torts and conflicts of interest.The journal is often cited in published court opinions, and is the most cited law journal in the category "Civil Litigation and Dispute Resolution" in the Washington &amp; Lee Law School law journal rankings as of 2020.</td>
