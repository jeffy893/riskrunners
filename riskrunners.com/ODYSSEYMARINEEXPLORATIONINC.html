      <td>Key employee, in U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) terminology, is an employee classification used when determining if company-sponsored qualified retirement plans, including 401(a) defined benefit plans and 401(k)s, are considered "top-heavy" or, in other words, weighted towards the company's more highly compensated individuals.A key employee is defined by the IRS as an employee, either living or dead, who meets one of the following three criteria:\n\nAn officer making over $175,000 in 2018 or $180,000 in 2019 (the income threshold is indexed by the IRS and may increase each year);\nA 5% owner of the business (defined as one who either owns more than 5% of the business, or is credited with more than 5% ownership of the business through Family-Attribution Rules), or\nAn employee owning more than 1% of the business and making over $150,000 for the plan year.All other employees are referred to as non-key employees.There are some similarities between key employees and so-called highly compensated employees (HCE), but the compensation salary threshold is lower for HCEs, at only $120,000 versus $150,000 for key employees.</td>

Preferred stocks are senior (i.e., higher ranking) to common stock but subordinate to bonds in terms of claim (or rights to their share of the assets of the company, given that such assets are payable to the returnee stock bond) and may have priority over common stock (ordinary shares) in the payment of dividends and upon liquidation.</td>
