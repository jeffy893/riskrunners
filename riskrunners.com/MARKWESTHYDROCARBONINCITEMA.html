According to natural law theory, all people have inherent rights, conferred not by act of legislation but by "God, nature, or reason." Natural law theory can also refer to "theories of ethics, theories of politics, theories of civil law, and theories of religious morality."In the Western tradition it was anticipated by the Pre-Socratics, for example in their search for principles that governed the cosmos and human beings.</td>
