      <td>Royalties for Regions is a political policy formulated by the National Party in 2008 which involves the redirection of Western Australian state government spending from the major population centres, particularly Perth, into the rural areas of the state.  This spending would be funded by setting aside 25% of the state's mining and petroleum royalty revenue.Following the 2008 state election, the National Party used its balance of power in the WA parliament to form government with the Liberals led by Colin Barnett, by trading Nationals support in exchange for spending guarantees under the policy.</td>
