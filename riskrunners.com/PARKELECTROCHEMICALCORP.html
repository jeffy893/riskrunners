      <td>Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market. As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring.</td>

      <td>The approximate number system (ANS) is a cognitive system that supports the estimation of the magnitude of a group without relying on language or symbols.  The ANS is credited with the non-symbolic representation of all numbers greater than four, with lesser values being carried out by the parallel individuation system, or object tracking system.</td>

      <td>In mathematics, a field F is algebraically closed if every non-constant polynomial in F[x] (the univariate polynomial ring with coefficients in F) has a root in F.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nAs an example, the field of real numbers is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation x2 + 1 = 0  has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients (1 and 0) are real.  The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed.</td>
