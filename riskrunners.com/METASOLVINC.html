John Peters argues the difficulty of defining communication emerges from the fact that communication is both a universal phenomenon (because everyone communicates) and a specific discipline of institutional academic study.One definitional strategy involves limiting what can be included in the category of communication (for example, requiring a "conscious intent" to persuade).</td>
