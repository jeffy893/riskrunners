      <td>A Health Reimbursement Account, formally a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), is a type of US employer-funded health benefit plan that reimburses employees for out-of-pocket medical expenses and, in limited cases, to pay for health insurance plan premiums.An HRA is not truly an account, since it does not place funds under a separate legal title. Instead, it is an agreement under which the employee can submit qualified health expenses to the employer for reimbursement.Following implementation of the Affordable Care Act, HRAs must be integrated with a qualified employer-sponsored group health insurance plan to avoid excise tax penalties.</td>
