      <td>Competition is an interaction between organisms or species in which both require a resource that is in limited supply (such as food, water, or territory). Competition lowers the fitness of both organisms involved, since the presence of one of the organisms always reduces the amount of the resource available to the other.In the study of community ecology, competition within and between members of a species is an important biological interaction.</td>
