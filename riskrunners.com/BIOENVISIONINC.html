Two years later, in December 1943, with a promise of support from the Alabama Power Company, Martin reengaged the Alabama's industrial leaders and received over $100,000 in philanthropic donations.Alabama Power Company pledged an additional US$15,000 per year for five years, $75,000 total, and this was enough for the organization to finance laboratory space and hire researchers and staff.</td>
