Guenin describes the "kernel" of intellectual honesty to be "a virtuous disposition to eschew deception when given an incentive for deception".Intentionally committed fallacies in debates and reasoning are called intellectual dishonesty.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAcademic honesty\nConflict of interest\nEpistemic feedback\nGood faith\nIntellectual\nList of fallacies\nScientific method\nSophism\nSystemic bias\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\nToledo-Pereyra, Luis H.
