# Lean Dream

## The actual dream

is AR glasses allowing us to do Legend of Zelda style adventures in the national parks; as well as, discovering nature to then collect the magic-wanded CAD files.

## The pitfall

is spending too much RAM on the retrospective covariance equation on a timelapse of historical porfolios + stochastic simulations

## The takeaway of the pitfall

is the derivation of the Black-Scholes equation is the history of mathemtics in a nutshell - indicating that financial markets in perfectly-efficient information systems are actually very predictable; yet, we are in a semi-efficient information system; such that, private information is what moves the market most of all.

## The antifragile approach

Utilizing the [Risk Runners Website](https://riskrunners.com), without numerical financial data, is an optimum approach for my purposes. It took time and the availability of LLMs to make possible the generation and utilization of predicate calculus - applied to public company risk factors.

## The formation

1. Choose an archetypal company
2. Process the risk factors into Prolog Scripts
3. Ask the LLM to generate insightful queries
4. Learn, think, create
5. Store documentation in corpus

## The integration

Utilizing a MCP with Cortext (which generates the html pages on the Risk Runners website), to then generate prolog scripts and to finally document the predicate calculus in a wiki-type repository, is an ideal way to track our learned conditionals throughout the coming seasons. This aiming towards the Grand Arbiter... with applications in Insurance, Law, and Family [survitality](https://perrydime.com/survivtality.html)... I am, however, concerned that the insurance applications are right-bound in spirit and direction...

## The execution


This is the corpus of Prolog scripts and queries against the [extracted risks](../riskrunners.com/) from public company annual reports.

## Basic Prompt to Gemini 2.5 Pro

```sql
Generate a prolog script from the following risk factors

and provide a list of queries that would be insightful

[Paste Risk Factors ...]

```
