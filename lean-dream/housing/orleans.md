* Claim_Or_Liability = construction_defect_claims ;
* Claim_Or_Liability = product_liability_claims ;

### Hypothesis
## Did business operations interruptions insurance being retrospecitvely added to the insurance policies adversely impact the ability to make claims?

- Virus Exclusions: Many policies already contained exclusions for losses caused by viruses or pandemics, which insurers invoked to deny claims.
- Insurers argued (and courts largely agreed) that pandemic-related shutdowns or the presence of the virus did not constitute direct physical loss or damage in the way typically covered (like fire or flood damage).
