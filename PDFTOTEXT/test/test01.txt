Chemopreventive Potential of Volatile Oil From Black Cumin (Nigella
sativa L.) Seeds Against Rat Colon Carcinogenesis

Elsayed I. Salim and Shoji Fukushima

Abstract: Chemopreventive effects of orally administered
Nigella sativa oil on the induction and development of
1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF),
putative preneoplastic lesions for colon cancer, were investi-
gated in Fischer 344 rats. Starting at 6 wk of age, 45 male
rats (groups 1–3) were subcutaneously injected with DMH
once a week for 3 wk. Group 1 (15 rats) served as a carcino-
gen control group without N. sativa administration. Group 2
or 3 (15 rats each) were given the oil in the postinitiation
stage or in the initiation stage, respectively. Animals of group
4 (11 rats) were injected with 0.9% saline and received N.
sativa oil from the beginning until the termination. At sacri-
fice, 14 wk after the start, the total numbers of ACF as well as
those with at least four crypts were significantly reduced in
group 2 (P < 0.01). However, treatment with N. sativa oil in
the initiation stage (group 3) did not exhibit significant inhib-
itory effects except on foci with only one aberrant crypt.
Immunohistochemical analysis of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine
labeling in colonic crypts revealed the N. sativa oil to have
significant antiproliferative activity in both initiation and
postinitiation stages and especially in the latter. Histological
examination revealed no pathological changes in the liver,
kidneys, spleen, or other organs of rats treated with N. sativa.
In addition, biochemical parameters of blood and urine as
well as body weight gain were not affected. These findings
demonstrate that the volatile oil of N. sativa has the ability to
inhibit colon carcinogenesis of rats in the postinitiation
stage, with no evident adverse side effects, and that the inhi-
bition may be associated, in part, with suppression of cell
proliferation in the colonic mucosa.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer is now the third most common malig-
nant neoplasm in the world (1). It has been proposed that this
disease may be partly caused by daily exposure to food car-
cinogens (2) and, although these cannot be eliminated from
our environment, chemoprevention is an alternative ap-

proach to decreasing carcinogenic effects. Experimentally,
natural chemopreventive agents have been shown to exert in-
hibitory effects on the initiation, promotion, and progression
stages in carcinogenesis (3). To avoid adverse side effects, at-
tention has been concentrated on nontoxic medicinal plants
as candidates for cancer chemoprevention.

Nigella sativa L. is an annual of the family of
Ranunculaceae herbaceous plants growing in many coun-
tries, especially those ringing the Mediterranean Sea. Its
black seeds (also termed black cumin seeds) are also em-
ployed in some parts of Asia, as well as France and Germany,
as a condiment. In fact it appears that the early Egyptians al-
ready used these seeds as a flavoring agent, and it is now find-
ing application by Syrians for cheese flavoring and by Amer-
icans for addition to bakery products (4). Furthermore, the
black seeds of N. sativa are reputed to have many medicinal
purposes (5), and extracted volatile oils possess various
antimicrobial, anthelmintic, diuretic, diaphonetic, and
anti-asthmatic actions (6).

On the experimental level, aqueous extracts of the black
seeds have been found to exert significant antiulcer effects in
rats (7), and the extracted oil was found to ameliorate
cisplatin-induced toxicity in mice (8) and shows significant
antimicrobial activities against different types of bacteria and
pathogenic yeasts (9). Recently, extracted proteins from N.
sativa demonstrated effects on the immune system, the
proliferative response of spleen lymphocytic cells to
allogenic cells and their IL-3 production being elevated in
BALB/c mice (10). Also, the N. sativa oil was shown to pro-
tect against murine cytomegalovirus infection by increasing
the numbers of CD4+ helper T-cells, numbers and suppressor
function of macrophages cells, and serum levels of inter-
feron-γ production (11). Furthermore, the N. sativa seed vol-
atile oil has been found to possess antineoplastic effects in vi-
tro against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, Dalton’s lymphoma
ascites, and sarcoma (S-180) cell lines (12).

contributions of active forms is limited. The major compo-

nents of Egyptian and Russian N. sativa have, however, been
identified. Babayan et al. (4) studied fatty acid and amino acid
compositions of N. sativa L. seeds from Egypt, and from other
parts of the Middle East, and reported a composition of 21%
protein, 35.5% fat, 6.6% fiber, 5.5% moisture, and 3.7% ash,
with the rest (27.7%)being total carbohydrates.Theseedsalso
contain minerals, vitamins, and polyphenols as other constitu-
ents. Similar data were obtained on analysis of Saudi Arabian
(13) and Turkish black seeds (14).

Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colonic mucosa were
first observed in the carcinogen-treated rodent colon (15),
and Pretlow and co-workers (16) showed that these lesions
are also present in the colonic mucosa of patients with colon
cancers. Large ACF (≥4 AC) are likely precursors of tumors
(17). Molecular analysis has revealed alteration of the adeno-
matous polyposis coli (APC)/β-catenin pathway and gene
mutation to be one of the earliest events in colorectal carci-
noma development, being found in dysplastic ACF (18).
Therefore, ACF in the rodent colon can be used for colon
carcinogenesis, and many chemopreventive agents have been
identified in this way (19,20).

Enhancement of cell proliferation is widely understood to
bean importantdeterminantof targetorgancarcinogenicityby
exerting a positive influence on the rate of gene alteration (21).
Genotoxic carcinogenic substances generally enhance cell
proliferation specifically in their target tissues. For example,
1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) enhances cellular prolifera-
tion in the colon but not in the liver or kidney (22). Increase in
the numbers of cycling cells, particularly in the S-phase, lead-
ing to expansion of the cell-proliferating zone and increased
crypt heights, is considered to be a risk factor for tumor devel-
opment along with deregulation of apoptosis (23).

In the present study we studied the possible inhibitory ef-
fects of the volatile oil of N. sativa on DMH-induced rat co-
lon carcinogenesis using ACF as surrogate end-point lesions
in place of colon cancer and BrdU labeling as an index of cel-
lular proliferation. We also checked possible toxic side ef-
fects of N. sativa with attention concentrated on quantitative
values for biochemical parameters of the blood and urine as
well as growth rates and histopathology of different body or-
gans and tissues.

Materials and Methods

Animals

A total of 56 male 5-wk-old F-344 rats (Charles River,
Hino, Shiga, Japan) were housed five per plastic cage with
wood chips for bedding in an animal room with a 12-h
light/12-h dark cycle at 22 ± 2°C and 45 ± 5% relative
humidity. Body weight and food intake were measured
weekly during the experiment. Diet (CE2 pellet diet, Clea,
Inc., Osaka) and water were available ad libitum.

Chemicals

DMH dihydrochloride (purity 99%) was purchased from
Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Crude extra
virgin extracted oil of N. sativa was purchased from Kahira
Co. (Cairo, Egypt). The oil was stored shaded from light in
dark glass bottles at room temperature between 15°C and
20°C. The chemical composition of the N. sativa oil was pre-
viously reported (13,14). A calculated dose of 200 mg/kg
body weight of the oil was diluted in 0.5% carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC) as a solvent. The oil in 0.5 ml of the solvent
was given daily to the rats by intragastric gavage (i.g.). The
200-mg/kg body weight dose of the oil was estimated after
showing no signs of toxicity when administered to the same
rat strain in a previous preliminary short-term toxicity test in
our laboratory using different doses of the oil (data not
shown).

Experimental Protocol

The experimental design is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, 56
male rats were divided into 4 groups at 5 wk of age. After 1
wk of laboratory acclimation, animals of groups 1–3 (15 rats
each) received DMH (20 mg/kg body weight) subcutane-
ously (s.c.) once a week for 3 wk between Weeks 4 and 6 af-
ter the start of the experiment. Rats in group 4 (11 rats) were
injected with 0.9% saline (vehicle) following the same
schedule. Group 1 received no N. sativa oil and served as a
carcinogen positive control. Rats of group 2 were adminis-

tered the freshly diluted N. sativa oil in CMC for 8 wk, after
the carcinogen administration (postinitiation administra-
tion), and group 3 received the N. sativa oil from the start of
the experiment until Week 6 (before and during the initiation
period), 1 day after the last injection of DMH. Animals of
group 4 received the N. sativa oil from the beginning to the
end of the experiment to determine any side effects. All ani-
mals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia at Week 14. Five
rats from each group received a single injection of
5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma Chemicals, St.
Louis, MO; 100 mg/kg body weight i.p.) 1 h before sacrifice.

Analysis of Blood and Urine

Blood was collected at the time of autopsy from 10 rats
that had not received BrdU (due to its high toxicity) in groups
1–3 and from 6 rats in group 4. Blood in heparinized syringes
was immediately centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.
Supernatant plasma was collected and preserved frozen at
–80°C before measurement of different electrolytes (Hitachi
electrolyte analyzer, Tokyo), total protein, albumin (Hitachi
736), and globulin (Aloka ARC 950, Tokyo).

Fresh urine samples were collected from all animals by
forced urination in the morning 1 day before the termination.
The urine pH was measured (Horiba model F-15 pH meter,
Tokyo) and the urine samples were preserved frozen at
–80°C until analyzed for electrolytes and proteins as men-
tioned above.

Histological Evaluation

The liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and testes were removed
and weighed, routinely embedded in paraffin, sectioned at
3–4 µm in thickness, and prepared for histological examina-
tion after staining with hematoxylin and eosin.

ACF Assay

After removal and fixation for at least 24 h at 4°C, colons
were stained in 0.2% methylene blue (in H2O) for 3–5 min,
divided into proximal, intermediate, and distal segments, and
examined for ACF under a light microscope. Aberrant crypts
were distinguished from the surrounding normal crypts by
their increased size and easily discernable pericryptal zone.
The numbers in each segment as well as the number of aber-
rant crypts in each focus were determined. Immediately after
scoring ACF, samples collected from the proximal, interme-
diate, and distal colons were prepared for routine histological
examination and BrdU immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemical Staining for BrdU

A mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdU (code no. M0744,
Dako A/S, Denmark) was used with the avidin-biotin com-
plex (ABC) method. Briefly, sections after deparaffinization
and hydration were incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide
for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. They

were then incubated with 10% normal horse serum at room
temperature for 30 min to block background staining and
overnight at 4°C with BrdU antibody diluted 1:500 in
tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-buffered saline (TBS).
After exposure for 30 min at room temperature to
biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Inc., Burlingame,
CA), sections were incubated with ABC at 1:25 dilution.
Each step was followed by washing with TBS. Peroxidase
activity was visualized by treatment with a 0.02% solution of
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride containing 0.05% hy-
drogen peroxide. The nuclei were counterstained with
hematoxylin.

Analysis of Cell Proliferation in Colon
Crypts

To score cell proliferation, cells stained for BrdU expres-
sion were counted from the base up each side of midaxially
sectioned colon crypts to the mouth of the crypt. Counts were
made for all complete crypts found in four or five sections
from each of the proximal, intermediate, and distal colon seg-
ments of every rat injected with BrdU. The total numbers of
the proliferating cells were divided by the total numbers of
the cells per crypt X100 to generate the BrdU labeling index
(LI).

Statistical Analysis

The significance of differences between group mean val-
ues for ACF and immunohistochemistry data was analyzed
using the SuperANOVA Duncan New Multiple Range analy-
sis (StatView ver. 5J, SAS Institute, NC).

Results

General Observations

All rats were healthy and survived to the final sacrifice.
The growth rates were consistent during the experiment with
no differences among the groups, and final body weights
demonstrated no intergroup variation (Table 1). Average ab-
solute and relative organ weights also did not show any sig-
nificant differences among the groups (Table 1). Food con-
sumption and water intake were the same for all groups (data
not shown).

ACF Assay

Table 2 summarizes data for the effects of N. sativa ad-
ministration on induction or development of ACF in the co-
lon. The rats treated with DMH (groups 1–3) showed 100%
incidence of ACF, in contrast to the negligible incidence of
ACF in rats of group 4 without DMH treatment, with only
two rats having two incidental foci. In the animals adminis-
tered N. sativa after DMH initiation (group 2), average total
numbers of ACF per colon as well as the numbers of foci con-

taining 1, 3, and ≥4 crypts were significantly decreased com-
pared with group 1 (DMH alone). Numbers of foci contain-
ing two crypts were also decreased, although this did not
reach statistical significance. The inhibition was marked
along the length of the colon and was not restricted to any
particular region. Pre- and concurrent administration of N.
sativa in group 2 caused slight inhibition in all size groups of
ACF but was only statistically significant for those compris-
ing one aberrant crypt.

BrdU Labeling Indexes

Immunohistochemical examination showed BrdU-la-
beled nuclei to be mostly located in the lower third of the
crypts (Fig. 2A and B). Fig. 3 illustrates differences in ratios
of BrdU-labeled nuclei in rat colonic crypts.
Postadministration of N. sativa (group 2) was found to re-
duce significantly the BrdU LI in the mucosal crypts com-
pared with the group 1 value (P < 0.01). Pre- and simulta-
neous treatment (group 3) was also found to cause a
significant reduction in the BrdU LI of the colonic epithelium
of rats (P < 0.05).

Plasma Biochemistry and Urine
Concentration Levels

Plasma values of total protein, creatinine, albumin, and al-
bumin/globulin (A/G) ratio were not changed among the
groups (Table 3). Slight nonsignificant reduction in calcium
ion levels was noted in rats of group 3. Urinary excretion lev-
els of electrolytes, urinary protein, and creatinine were also
not changed among the groups (Table 4).

Histological Examination of the Other
Organs

Gross and microscopic examination of the liver, kidneys,
spleen, testes, and accessory sex organs as well as the lungs,
stomach, intestine, and thyroid gland in all groups revealed
no histopathological changes.

Discussion

The present study indicates that N. sativa administration is
effective for inhibition of colon carcinogenesis during the
postinitiation phase. Thus, development of ACF, irrespective
of thesizeor locationwithin thecolon,wassuppressed inasso-
ciation with a prominent reduction of cellular proliferation.

ACFs are linked with colon cancer development from the
viewpoint of their dysplastic appearance, relation to cellular
proliferation, and genetic alterations such as expression of
cyclin D1 (24), and APC and K-ras gene mutations (25). The
incidence of colon tumors in the rats is especially known to
correlate with numbers of large ACFs (≥4 crypts/focus),
which are more likely to progress into tumors and to demon-
strate elevation in cell proliferation (17,26). Reduction of
ACF number and multiplicity generally demonstrates a rela-
tionship with cancer chemoprevention (27–29). Therefore,
the finding of significant reduction of large ACFs observed
here may point to an inhibitory effect on tumor yield in the
long term.

BrdU LI is widely used as a biomarker for estimating cell
proliferation (30). Postadministration of N. sativa markedly
inhibited the LI in all colonic regions. Interestingly, this was
also the case for pre- and simultaneous administration of N.

sativa (group 3). Modulation of cell proliferation by cancer
chemopreventive agents in colon epithelium is widely con-
sidered to be a mechanism underlying the protective action
(20,31). In group 3 N. sativa oil had no significant effect on
tumorigenesis when administered during initiation stage, al-
though BrdU LIs were significantly inhibited, suggesting
that BrdU LI may not be the only relevant biomarker to pre-

dict the chemopreventive efficacy of N. sativa, at least in the
case of group 3. Further investigation of the relevance of
other permissive genetic or biochemical factors, particularly
those related to induction of apoptosis, may be of great im-
portance in this case.

To our knowledge, only two earlier reports showed N.
sativa to have potent cancer chemopreventive potential.

Salomi et al. (32) showed that postinitiation application of a
dose of crude oil extracts of N. sativa seeds delayed the onset
of dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced skin
papilloma formation and reduced the number of papillomas
per mouse while inhibiting methylcholanthrene induction of
soft tissue sarcomas. El-Mofty et al. (33), using a similar
DMBA protocol, reported that topical application of chemi-
cally extracted or naturally extracted N. sativa oil markedly
reduced the appearance of skin tumors in female BALB/c
mice.

The precise mechanism of tumor inhibition by N. sativa
volatile oil is not known. However, it has been found that
polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute 83.7% of the total fat in
black seeds (14), with linoleic acid (cis-C18:2 ω-6) as the
major component (60.8%) and oleic acid (cis-C18:1 ω-9)

constituting 21.9% of total fats. Concerning cancer preven-
tion, it was found that ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibit
inhibitory effects on various kinds of tumors in animal exper-
iments, and epidemiological studies have shown that they
may exert protective influence in humans (34). However,
there is convincing evidence that dietary oils rich in ω-6
polyunsaturated fatty acids exerted strong tumor-enhancing
effects on mammary and colon cancer incidence in rats and
mice (34,35). Therefore, the significant reduction in ACF
numbers observed here might not be considered directly re-
lated to linoleic acid content in N. sativa oil.

The presence of antioxidants such as tocopherols and
polyphenols in oil extracted from N. sativa seeds could be im-
portant. The total tocopherol (α-, β-, and γ-tocopherols) con-
tent in N. sativa seeds was found to be about 340 µg/g, whereas

total polyphenols are present at 1,744 µg/g (14). Naturally oc-
curring plant phenols are widely distributed and many have
been found to protect against chemical carcinogenesis
(36–38). Some plant phenols have been found to inhibit the ac-
tivity of cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes that metabo-
lize drugs and carcinogens (39). Therefore, the possibility that
whether polyphenols exist in N. sativa oil (14) might be in-
volved in the present chemopreventive findings deserves fur-
ther investigation.

It is noteworthy to mention that our histological and bio-
chemical investigations of different parameters in the present
experiment showed no signs of unfavorable side effects with
administration of oil of seeds of N. sativa. Although the exact
mechanisms of the chemopreventive effects of N. sativa oil
and its constituents need to be determined, the evidence de-
scribed here indicates that further research on the modifying
effects of the constituents on different types of cancer is war-
ranted.
