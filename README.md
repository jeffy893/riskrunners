## Two highlights are the Python Scripts for:


- Custom Distribution Sampling --> Exposure Simulation
- Stock Portfolio Covariance --> How Much to Weight Each Stock!


# Assumptions / Expectations (2024-02-25)

## Lifecycle Exposure Management

1. Mitigating risks DURING a lifetime is akin to Health Insurance
2. Mitigating risks BEFORE and AFTER a lifetime is akin to Property and Casualty Insurance

## Premium = Rate x Exposure

- Rate is the financial mathematics aspect of actuarial science
    - Financial Instruments are designed to get folks involved with spreading out the risks
- Exposure is the probability aspect of actuarial science
    - Simulation and Sensors are used to model the "forensics" of processes and materials to contribute to the multivariate equation of indemnification

## PFMEA --> Underwriting Cycle

- Process Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) is a methodology for looking at the points of failure and bottlenecks in a process so as to trace back what went wrong or prevent things from going wrong in the future
- The Underwriting Cycle starts from Execess and Surplus (E&S) and ends in the primary insurance lines
    1. When public awareness spreads (tracked by breadth and depth of hashtag awareness) about a risk factor, this spawns the requests for E&S to indemnify something not yet modeled
    2. "Sherlocks" are sent out to model the exposures
        - **2.1 Managerial Influence is kept in consideration**
    3. Financial Instruments are designed to incentivize folks to spread out the risks
    4. Given enough involvement, the New Policy line will exit E&S and enter maintstream insurance

## Process and Material Flow

- Bill of Process (BOP) is a document that is used in Product Lifecyle Management software (e.g. Teamcenter, Windchill) - along with Bill of Material - to throttle the butterfly effect of change management
    - Tim may be working on a part
    - The PLM tool will simulate stress on the part with ISO/IEEE standards
    - THe PLM tool will notify Jamal that Tim's part will impact Jamal's part under potential stress on the system
        - If Tim changes the material of a bolt to copper, and the bolt heats up, the bolt could break the nut that Jamal is working on

## Predicate Calculus: Time Allocation (Basis)

- When converting reality into predicate calculus, so as to inform simulation, Time can be the allocation basis
    - Philosopher's DIning Problem
    - Process Flow Simulation
        - Supply Chain
            - e.g. Reuptake in the fashion industry
        - Shop Floor
        - Consumer Behavior
            - e.g. to socialize taste
- Traceablity on transactions, events, and opportunities is key to determining:
    1. If someone will pay back their debt
    2. The expected indirect costs when working with someone

## Determining if someone will pay back their debt

- Collecting demographics through the Census allows anyone to use these differentiators when determing this
- The secondary market may use ANY variable when bundling and re-selling assets
    - although, the primary market may not

## Simulation and Sensors

- Parametric Insurance can be explained by the example of Earthquake Insurance:
    - A grid is drawn over San Diego and Tijuana
    - Seismic Reading Sensors are spread throughout
    - When the seismic reading is above a threshhold set by the market, insurance is automatically paid off
        - this is only possible when the process is **void of managerial influence**
    - Think about it: would the threshhold be higher or lower in San Diego than in Tijuana, if there is more money in the market in San Diego?
        - Akin to Airports being built in low income communities...

# Historical Context (2019-12-31)

## Natural Language Business Rule Processing

- Scraping Yelp pages for Hotel / Motel
- Synonymize the natural language of the indemnifications
    - e.g. No Alcohol on Premises
- Anomaly Detection and Notification
    - e.g. Someone mentions "I had a great Mom-mosa"
- Determine if folks are adhering to their policy or understand exposures before insuring
