<h1>Posterity</h1>
Posterity is an Android App that simulates the mating dances of Bison and Cattle<br>
Retrospectively, this could be considered:<br>
A Guerrilla Kriegsspiel intuited from Stochastic Processes and Differential Equations<br>
<br>
<h3>An Ehrenfest Chain incrementally "hands off" bounded constants to a Guerrilla Lanchester Law</h3><br>
<br>
The attrition factors are set in a way such that Bison are distinct from Cattle - differentiated by their Mating Dance<br>
The intent is to help figure out how to have a "come-up" in contexts ranging from Cafes to Discos<br>
Specifically, I mean transacting a business card with cordial intentions and consent by both parties<br>
The time period is always 1.5 Hours: to represent how much time you're likely to spend at each watering hole in a Pub Crawl<br>
<br>
The Heat Slider is meant to represent your subjective opinion of the likelihood of a dance<br>
The Pace Slider could be thought of as the average time between songs at the venue you are scoping out<br>
The Heat and Pace sliders are MEANT to be subjective - in that you have the will power to manage your energy with respect to the venue's cohesion, resource appropriation, and attrition<br>
<br>
The graph that appears after the simulation takes place is based on artificial criteria for:<br>
<h3>Should you approach a group of 3, 7, or 12?</h3>
<h4> - indicated by the Y Axis</h4>
<h3>Will Bison or Cattle win the conflict within 1.5 hours?</h3>
<h4> - indicated by the X Axis</h4>
<h3>Will there be a cross-over between Bison and Cattle?</h3>
<h4> - ideal for those aiming to experience an event with longevity and balance</h4>
<br>
When interpreted correctly, this may prompt you to shift your energy towards dancing like Bison or like Cattle - at the optimum moment<br>
It's up to you if you want to Go With the Flow when the venue is prompting for you:
<h4>to dance with potency, like Bison</h4>
or<br>
<h4>to take the path of least resistence, like Cattle.</h4>
