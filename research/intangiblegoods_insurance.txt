Intangible Goods
	Service Contracts, IP, Goodwill, Software, Trademarks, Data, rights-of-use, etc.

Service Contracts are written in artificial or natural language
	the trading of these contracts on primary and secondary markets
	Warranties or the promise of maintenance per a time period
	
Defamation of Character, Pride of Ownership, Reputation

Tangible assets are 60% covered
Intangible assets are 16% covered

4 Categories
	Contracted Rights
		Franchise and Royalty Agreements
		Licensing Arrangements
		Mineral Extractions Rights
		Import Quotas
		Negotiated Instruments
	Capitalised R$D Spending
	Goodwill
	Brand Value


Accounting standards have different ways of:
Depreciation and Amortization

Difference between value and price paid for intangible assets
high uncertainty

Goodwill is calculated by the difference between balanced
	and non-balanced debits and credits
	
Leads to borrowing capacity

What is the difference between goodwill and credit?

R&D can be classified as Goodwill if bought from another
	not if developed by self
	
Buying a business unit at above book value increases goodwill
Buyback of internal shares increases treasury stocks

A brand is a set of perceptions and feelings that a company owns
	 in the mind of a consumer.
	 Tries to establish a set of emotional responses.
	 Apple Brand of $205bn means $26 per person on the planet
		Somewhere in the brain alongside memories, fears, and motivations
			is Apple, and its worth $26
			
1. Cost-based approach
	advertising, promotional expenses, trademarks
2. Income Based
	Future expected revenue stream
3. Consumer Survey
	Public sentiment


Can build portfolios of old patents
IP infringement typically not covered in standard commercial
	general liability insurance policy

Defensive policies
	Covers settlements
Enforcement Policies
	Allows policyholder to sue

Based on legal costs, not commercial costs or lost revenues
	those damages will presumably be gained in the winning of the lawsuit
	
Patent needs to be embodied in a machine, tool, or process

If a software is deemed to improve a computer's functionality
	it is patentable
	but if the software performs a generalized functionality
		and only uses the computer, then deemed as "abstract idea"
		Mathematical algorithms are not patentable

Oil Reserves = Analog Data
Crude Oil = Digital Data
Petroleum = Information

Data being fungible
	able to replace or be replaced by another identical item;
	mutually interchangeable
Depends on context - who knows it at what time
Users give facebook, but not banks or hospitals, the right to mne their data


Value of data can be found from the losses due to the breach of data

Cyber Insurance
	Business interruption, data recovery, regulatory fines, ransom demands
	customer monitoring & recompense, PR and communications expenses
	other costs required to bring systems back to normal
	
Net Diligence in Dec 2019 valued data breach at $178k for SME
	$5.6m for large company
	
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability

To diversify real estate, buy in different geographic locations

Parametric Insurance
Index triggers enough to start the claims process
	Rainfall volume, Seismic Intensity

Traditional insurance has base coverage and then outlines exclusions,
	deductibles, and limits
	Best for high frequency, easily modelable events
PInsurance is based on inclusion, not exclusions

Initially developed from catastrophic bonds (insurance-linked security) to provide
	reinsurance for major disasters
	Draw grid and if earthquake metric above marker then triggers payment
	Pays out from one of the bonds in the series
	
	Also for aggeregate or indirect lost from crop failure
	
Futures in ILS

Trigger and payout mechanism requires
	IID RV - Independent and Identically Distributed Random Variables

Need claims data to figure out risk in traditional insurance
Parametric Insurance ises non-traditional sources

Product differentiation

PInsurance does not need to set up chains of causality
	if metric happens, then payout

A platform that allows risk holders to trade insurance linked securities
	Cheaper claims process
	Blockchain makes it easier
	
Blockchain style distributed ledgers
	Smart contracts
	
Typically, transaction risk transferred to central authority

Smart Contract
	Items are clauses
	Actions are how to transfer funds
	Permissions are the triggers to transfer funds
	
Blockchain works by items, actions, and permissions

ML allows for sophisticated triggers

Platform companies fascilitate exchanges between producers and consumers

Relationship between the risk and the index

Adverse Basis Risk
	Damage occurs but index not triggered
Perverse Basis Risk
	Index triggered but no damages
	
If too much perverse risk, then instrument becomes derivative
	Proper level of granularity
	
Relative level of independence

Brand Insurance Indices could be based on if service or product reverse engineered
	and introduced to market...

Brands increase desirability regardless of materials in product/service
Management linked parametric triggers would not pass the
	independence and moral hazard criteria
	
Brand names can be linked to derogatory words or pejoratives
	coverage can be logged and indexed
	
Panemic catastrophe bonds
	Infection rates, speed of spread, fatality statistics
	basis for triggers
	Every city can be reaached in three flights
	Train delays more than 30 minutes


Then indices set by market

First of all, I was on the ede of my seat during the entire document.
Everything came together on Page 29.
Please see my attached Big Data Portfolio.
Where are the markets that drive triggers?
For instance, the earthquake bonds backed insurance could have a seismic reading metric of
	6.5 when the risk is first put on the market. Then, the market could push that metric up and down.
Auger is an upcoming prediction market.
