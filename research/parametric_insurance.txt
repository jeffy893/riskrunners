How the claims department is being undervalued with a parametric insurance model
or, at least, how the metrics have to be designed in a way that the following immunized

The claims department determines the distribution of negligence and intention between the plaintiff and the defendant

How this relates to responsibility futures

Claims tend to not be all or nothing
If a claim is paid off, this legally attributes all negligence onto the defendent/cause

The defendent needs to be clearly determined as being:

Duty, Breach, Cause, Harm

With intangible assets, it is critical that duty, breach, cause, and harm are considered

Are there strict standards and guidelines and a review team to monitor and regulate the design of metrics
Know that the attribution of negligence and intention will be assumed by the payoff

Though the coin has percentages of interest and return
and the claim payoff also has percentages because the metric will be a real number
