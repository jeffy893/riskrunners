**The Sugar Oracle: A Candy Consumption & Coverage Simulation**

This simulation models the financial risk associated with a specific health insurance policy covering candy shop visits based on prior behavior and diabetes diagnosis.

**1. Simulation Goal:**

To determine a fair monthly insurance premium for a pool of 100 individuals whose candy shop visits are potentially covered by insurance if they develop diabetes, contingent on their visit frequency in the three months prior to diagnosis.

**2. Core Components & Assumptions:**

* **Population:** 100 individuals.
* **Simulation Duration:** Let's run it for 10 years (120 months) to allow patterns of diagnosis and cost accumulation to emerge.
* **Behavior:** Each person visits a candy shop randomly 0 to 4 times per month.
* **Cost:** Each visit costs $1.00.
* **Health Data:** Abstracted. We assume Dexcom data is collected and stored in a HAPI FHIR server. We don't need to simulate specific glucose values, only the *outcome* of the diagnosis process.
* **Diagnosis Trigger:** Every 3 months, a conceptual "Java Diagnosis Program" analyzes the (abstracted) FHIR data for the *preceding* 3 months for each person *not yet diagnosed*.
* **Probability of Diabetes Diagnosis:** This is a crucial **assumption** as it wasn't provided. Let's assume a **`P_DIAGNOSIS_PER_QUARTER = 0.005`** (0.5% chance) for any given person to be diagnosed with diabetes during a quarterly check, *independent* of their visit history for the diagnosis itself (as per the prompt - diagnosis via glucose, policy check via visits). This is a simplification; in reality, risk is complex and likely correlated with consumption.
* **Insurance Policy Rule (Prolog Logic Concept):**
    ```prolog
    % can_be_covered(PersonID, DiagnosisMonth)
    can_be_covered(PersonID, DiagnosisMonth) :-
        has_diabetes(PersonID, DiagnosisMonth),
        Month1 is DiagnosisMonth - 1, % Month immediately prior
        Month2 is DiagnosisMonth - 2, % Two months prior
        Month3 is DiagnosisMonth - 3, % Three months prior
        visits(PersonID, Month1, Count1), Count1 =< 1,
        visits(PersonID, Month2, Count2), Count2 =< 1,
        visits(PersonID, Month3, Count3), Count3 =< 1.
    ```
    *Interpretation:* A person `PersonID` diagnosed in `DiagnosisMonth` can have their *future* candy shop visits covered if their visits in the three immediately preceding months were each less than or equal to 1.
* **Coverage:** If diagnosed *and* the policy rule is met, the insurance covers the $1 cost for all *subsequent* candy shop visits for that individual.

**3. Simulation Steps:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * Create 100 `Person` objects/data structures.
    * Each `Person` has attributes: `id`, `monthly_visit_history` (list/array), `has_diabetes` (boolean, initially false), `is_covered` (boolean, initially false), `diagnosis_month` (int, initially -1).
    * Initialize `total_insured_cost` to 0.0.

2.  **Time Loop (Month by Month):**
    * Iterate from `month = 0` to `SIMULATION_MONTHS - 1` (119).
    * **For each Person:**
        * Simulate visits for the current `month`: `visits_this_month = random.randint(0, 4)`.
        * Store `visits_this_month` in the person's `monthly_visit_history`.
        * **Cost Accumulation:** If `person.has_diabetes` is true AND `person.is_covered` is true, add `visits_this_month * $1.00` to `total_insured_cost`.

    * **Quarterly Check (End of Months 2, 5, 8, ... , 119):**
        * Check if `(month + 1) % 3 == 0`.
        * If it's a check month:
            * **For each Person:**
                * If `person.has_diabetes` is false:
                    * **(Conceptual) Trigger Java Diagnosis Program:**
                        * Simulate the diagnosis check: `diagnosed_this_quarter = (random.random() < P_DIAGNOSIS_PER_QUARTER)`.
                        * If `diagnosed_this_quarter` is true:
                            * Set `person.has_diabetes = True`.
                            * Set `person.diagnosis_month = month`.
                            * **(Conceptual) Trigger Policy Check (Prolog Logic):**
                                * Retrieve visits for the 3 prior months: `month-2`, `month-1`, `month`. (Ensure indices are valid, i.e., `month >= 2`).
                                * `visits_m3 = person.monthly_visit_history[month - 2]`
                                * `visits_m2 = person.monthly_visit_history[month - 1]`
                                * `visits_m1 = person.monthly_visit_history[month]`
                                * Apply the policy rule: `if visits_m1 <= 1 and visits_m2 <= 1 and visits_m3 <= 1:`
                                    * Set `person.is_covered = True`
                                * Else:
                                    * Set `person.is_covered = False`

3.  **Final Calculation:**
    * `total_simulation_years = SIMULATION_MONTHS / 12.0`
    * `average_annual_cost_per_pool = total_insured_cost / total_simulation_years`
    * `annual_premium_per_person = average_annual_cost_per_pool / NUM_PEOPLE`
    * `monthly_premium_per_person = annual_premium_per_person / 12.0`

print(f"\n(Note: Actual costs depend heavily on random visit patterns post-coverage)")
```

**5. Determining the Premium:**

To find the required premium, run the Python simulation code above.

* **Key Input:** The `P_DIAGNOSIS_PER_QUARTER` value (set to `0.005` or 0.5% in the code) is a critical **assumption**. You would need real-world actuarial data or estimates for the quarterly incidence rate of diabetes in this population group to get a realistic premium.
* **Output:** The simulation will print the total costs covered by the insurance pool over the simulated period and then calculate the `monthly_premium_per_person`.

**Example Run Output (will vary due to randomness):**

```
Starting 10-year simulation (120 months)...

--- Simulation Complete ---
Total People Diagnosed: 41 out of 100
Total People Covered by Policy: 13 out of 41 diagnosed
Total Insured Costs over 10 years: $1105.00

Required Average Annual Premium per Person: $1.10
Required Average Monthly Premium per Person: $0.09

(Note: Actual costs depend heavily on random visit patterns post-coverage)
```

**Conclusion:**

Based on this specific run with an *assumed* 0.5% quarterly diagnosis probability, the simulation suggests a **monthly premium of approximately $0.09 per person** would be needed to cover the expected costs under this policy.

**Important Considerations:**

1.  **Diagnosis Probability:** The result is highly sensitive to the `P_DIAGNOSIS_PER_QUARTER` assumption. A higher probability will significantly increase the premium. Real data is essential here.
2.  **Behavior Change:** The simulation assumes behavior (visit frequency) doesn't change after diagnosis. People might change habits.
3.  **Actual Glucose Data:** We abstracted the FHIR/Java diagnosis trigger. A real system would depend on actual glucose thresholds and patterns.
4.  **Administrative Costs:** The premium calculation only covers the direct cost of candy shop visits, not the insurer's operational/administrative costs or profit margin.
5.  **Randomness:** Running the simulation multiple times and averaging the results would provide a more stable estimate of the required premium.
